# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Sparks photo sharing platform to support event organizers who need to upload and manage large collections of event photos through a dedicated desktop application. Event organizers will be able to upload images in bulk, organize them into albums, and make them available for viewing through a web interface. This system will integrate with the existing Sparks infrastructure while providing specialized functionality for professional event photography workflows.
