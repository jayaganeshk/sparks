# Sparks Business Metrics & Application Monitoring Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive business and application-focused monitoring implementation for the Sparks photo-sharing platform, including Cognito user data integration and advanced CloudWatch dashboards.

## Overview

The enhanced monitoring system now includes:
- **Cognito User Context Integration** - Complete user profile data in all traces and logs
- **Business Intelligence Metrics** - User behavior, feature adoption, and engagement tracking
- **Application Performance Monitoring** - User-centric performance analysis
- **Revenue-Focused Dashboards** - Premium user engagement and feature usage

## Cognito User Data Integration

### User Context Extraction

The system automatically extracts comprehensive user data from Cognito JWT tokens:

```javascript
// Core user identifiers
userId: cognitoPayload.sub
email: cognitoPayload.email
username: cognitoPayload['cognito:username']

// User attributes
name, givenName, familyName, preferredUsername

// Account status
emailVerified, phoneVerified

// Groups and roles
groups: cognitoPayload['cognito:groups']
roles: cognitoPayload['cognito:roles']

// Session information
authTime, issuedAt, expiresAt

// Derived properties
userType: 'admin' | 'premium' | 'beta' | 'standard'
accountAge: calculated in days
sessionDuration: calculated in minutes
```

### User Type Classification

Users are automatically classified based on Cognito groups:
- **Admin**: `admin`, `administrators` groups
- **Premium**: `premium`, `pro` groups  
- **Beta**: `beta`, `tester` groups
- **Standard**: Default classification

### Account Age Cohorts

Users are categorized into engagement cohorts:
- **NewUser**: â‰¤ 7 days
